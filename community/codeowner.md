# OPEA Project Code Owners

These tables list the GitHub code owners, as found in the CODEOWNERS file in the
corresponding OPEA repository. Code owners are responsible for code and
documentation in a repository. They are automatically requested for
review when someone opens a pull request (PR) that modifies code or
documentation that they own.

Select or contact the corresponding area owner for a PR review or questions
about content within a repository.
