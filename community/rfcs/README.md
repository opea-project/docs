# RFC Archive

This folder is used to archive all RFCs contributed by OPEA community. Either users directly contribute RFC to this folder or submit to each OPEA repository's `Issues` page with the `[RFC]: xxx` string pattern in title. The latter will be automatically stored to here by an archieve tool.

The file naming convention follows this rule: yy-mm-dd-[OPEA Project Name]-[index]-title.md

For example, 24-04-29-GenAIExamples-001-Using_MicroService_to_implement_ChatQnA.md
