Community Support
*****************

Welcome to the OPEA project community!

The OPEA Community includes developers from member organizations and the general
community all joining in the development of the project. Members contribute and
discuss ideas, submit bugs and bug fixes, and improve documentation. They also
help those in need through the community's forums and mailing lists. Anyone can
join the developer community and the community is always willing to help its
members and the User Community to get the most out of OPEA.
