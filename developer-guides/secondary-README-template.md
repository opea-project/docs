##Validation
<How do you validate the health of the microservices that are used in this sample?>

<For each microservice, your validation should display:>
- <The name of the microservice>
- <The test procedure used>
- <Applicable CURL commands>
- <An example of the expected output>

<Also include instructions to open the UI:>
- <What port should the developer use?>
- <Is port forwarding necessary?>
- <For Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud (ITAC), is a load balancer necessary?>
- <Do specific instructions apply for different UIs?>
- <What should the sample input and output look like? Include screenshots.>


##Profiling

<How do you prepare dashboards in Prometheus or Grafana for this purpose?>

##Termination
<How do you stop the microservices?>

##Troubleshooting
