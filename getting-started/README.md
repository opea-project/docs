# Getting Started with OPEA
In this document, we provide a tailored guide to deploying the ChatQnA application in OPEA GenAI Examples across multiple cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enabling you to choose the best fit for your specific needs and requirements. For additional deployment targets, see the [ChatQnA](/tutorial/ChatQnA/ChatQnA_Guide.rst).

## Understanding OPEA's Core Components

Before moving forward, it's important to familiarize yourself with two key elements of OPEA: GenAIComps and GenAIExamples.

- GenAIComps is a collection of microservice components that form a service-based toolkit. This includes a variety of services such as llm (large language models), embedding, and reranking, among others.
- GenAIExamples provides practical and deployable solutions to help users implement these services effectively. Examples include ChatQnA and DocSum, which leverage the microservices for specific applications.

:::{tab-item} Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud
:sync: ITAC

1. Sign up to create an account or log in to [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://ai.cloud.intel.com/). Check if you have sufficient cloud credits and purchase or redeem a coupon if needed. Go to the "Compute" tab on the left and click on "Instances". In the center of the screen, click on the "Launch instance" button.

2. Select your instance configuration, instance type, and machine image which will be Ubuntu.

>**Note**: It is recommended to use the `VM-SPR-LRG` powered by 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with 64GB of memory and 64GB of disk or more if you wish to use a CPU to run an 8B-parameter model.

3. Fill out the rest of the form such as giving your instance a name and answering any additional quesitons.

4. Add your public key for SSH. You can select a key you have previously uploaded or upload a key. The "Upload Key" button also provides instructions on how to create a new SSH key.

5. Click "Launch instance" to start your machine.

6. Go back to the "Compute" tab and under "Instances", note down the private IP address of your new VM.

7. If you wish to make the UI accessible to others, proceed to the next step to create a load balancer. Otherwise, skip to Step 10 which will explain how to connect to your VM with port forwarding.

8. Create a load balancer. This can be found in Compute->Load Balancers. Click on "Launch Load Balancer". Ignore any messages about signing up for access and close any pop-up windows if any. Fill out the form with the following info:
   - Name: **Name for your load balancer**
   - Source IP: **The private IP address of your VM in Step 6**
   - Listener Port: **80**
   - Instance Port: **80**
   - Monitor Type: **HTTP**
   - Mode: **Round Robin**
   - Instances: **Select the name of the VM you created**

   >**Note**: The port used is 80 because this is the NGINX port for the GenAI Examples.

   Click "Launch".

9. Go back to Compute->Load Balancers to see your new load balancer. Note down the virtual IP address. This is what you will use to access the UI of your GenAI Example on a web browser.

10. Connect to your VM using ssh and port forward port 80 if needed (`ssh -i <private_key> -J guest@<proxy_jump_ip_address> -L 80:localhost:80 ubuntu@<private_ip_address_of_vm`). If you are using a load balancer, you do not need to include `-L 80:localhost:80`.

## Deploy the ChatQnA Solution
Use the command below to install docker:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples/refs/heads/main/ChatQnA/docker_compose/install_docker.sh
chmod +x install_docker.sh
./install_docker.sh
```
Configure Docker to run as a non-root user by following these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

Clone the repo. It is recommended to checkout a specific release version (i.e. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc):
```bash
export RELEASE_VERSION=<your-release-version>
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples.git
cd GenAIExamples
git checkout tags/v${RELEASE_VERSION}
```

Set the required environment variables:
```bash
export host_ip="localhost"
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="Your_Huggingface_API_Token"
```

Set up proxies if you are behind a firewall:
```bash
export no_proxy=${your_no_proxy},$host_ip
export http_proxy=${your_http_proxy}
export https_proxy=${your_http_proxy}
```

Set up other specific use-case environment variables in `set_env.sh` before running it. For example, this is where you can change the model(s) to run with.
```bash
cd ChatQnA/docker_compose/intel/cpu/xeon/
source set_env.sh
```

Now we can start the services:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```
>**Note**: It takes a few minutes for the services to start. Check the logs for the services to ensure that ChatQnA is running before proceeding further.

For example to check the logs for the `vllm-service`:

```bash
docker logs vllm-service | grep Complete
```
Proceed further **only after** the output shows `Application startup complete.` as shown:
```bash
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:80 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Run `docker ps -a` as an additional check to verify that all the services are running as shown. Notice the version of the docker images matches the RELEASE_VERSION you specified.

### Interact with ChatQnA

You can interact with ChatQnA via a browser interface:

* To view the ChatQnA interface, open a browser and navigate to the UI by inserting your public facing IP address in the following: `http://{public_ip}:80’.

>**Note:** For users running on ITAC, open a browser to localhost:80 if you are using port forwarding OR the virtual IP address of your load balancer.

We can go ahead and ask a sample question, say 'What is OPEA?'.

A snapshot of the interface looks as follows:

![Chat Interface](assets/chat_ui_response.png)

Given that any information about OPEA was not in the training data for the model, we see the model hallucinating and coming up with a response. We can upload a document (PDF) with information and observe how the response changes.

> **Note:** this example leverages the OPEA document for its RAG based content. You can download the [OPEA document](assets/what_is_opea.pdf) and upload it using the UI.

![Chat Interface with RAG](assets/chat_ui_response_rag.png)

We observe that the response is relevant and is based on the PDF uploaded. See the [ChatQnA](/tutorial/ChatQnA/ChatQnA_Guide.rst)
to learn how you can customize the example with your own content.
