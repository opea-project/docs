# opea-project.github.io

This is the OPEA Project Documentation Publishing site for GitHub Pages.
Content changes are not made directly in this repo.  Instead, edit content in
the opea-project/docs and other repos, re-generate the HTML with Sphinx (make
html), and with the right permissions, push the updated content here for
publishing (make publish).

Read the published documentation on
[https://opea-project.github.io](https://opea-project.github.io).
