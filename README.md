- Detailed framework of composable building blocks for state-of-the-art generative AI systems including LLMs, data stores, and prompt engines 
- Architectural blueprints of retrieval-augmented generative AI component stack structure and end-to-end workflows 
- A four-step assessment for grading generative AI systems around performance, features, trustworthiness and enterprise-grade readiness
