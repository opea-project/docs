The OPEA platform includes: 

Detailed framework of composable building blocks for state-of-the-art generative AI systems including LLMs, data stores, and prompt engines 

Architectural blueprints of retrieval-augmented generative AI component stack structure and end-to-end workflows 

A four-step assessment for grading generative AI systems around performance, features, trustworthiness and enterprise-grade readiness
