ChatQnA Sample Guide
####################

.. note:: This guide is in its early development and is a work-in-progress with
   placeholder content.

Overview
********

Chatbots are a  widely adopted use case for leveraging the powerful chat and
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).  The ChatQnA example
provides the starting point for developers to begin working in the GenAI space.
Consider it the “hello world” of GenAI applications and can be leveraged for
solutions across wide enterprise verticals, both internally and externally.

Purpose
*******

The ChatQnA example uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) architecture,
which is quickly becoming the industry standard for chatbot development. It
combines the benefits of a knowledge base (via a vector store) and generative
models to reduce hallucinations, maintain up-to-date information, and leverage
domain-specific knowledge.

RAG bridges the knowledge gap by dynamically fetching relevant information from
external sources, ensuring that responses generated remain factual and current.
The core of this architecture are vector databases, which are instrumental in
enabling efficient and semantic retrieval of information. These databases store
data as vectors, allowing RAG to swiftly access the most pertinent documents or
data points based on semantic similarity.

Central to the RAG architecture is the use of a generative model, which is
responsible for generating responses to user queries. The generative model is
trained on a large corpus of customized and relevant text data and is capable of
generating human-like responses. Developers can easily swap out the generative
model or vector database with their own custom models or databases. This allows
developers to build chatbots that are tailored to their specific use cases and
requirements. By combining the generative model with the vector database, RAG
can provide accurate and contextually relevant responses specific to your users'
queries.

The ChatQnA example is designed to be a simple, yet powerful, demonstration of
the RAG architecture. It is a great starting point for developers looking to
build chatbots that can provide accurate and up-to-date information to users.

To facilitate sharing of individual services across multiple GenAI applications, use the GenAI Microservices Connector (GMC) to deploy your application. Apart from service sharing , it also supports specifying sequential, parallel, and alternative steps in a GenAI pipeline. In so doing, it supports dynamic switching between models used in any stage of a GenAI pipeline.  For example, within the ChatQnA pipeline, using GMC one could switch the model used in the embedder, re-ranker, and/or the LLM. 
Upstream Vanilla Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform (RHOCP) can be used with or without GMC, while use with GMC provides additional features.

The ChatQnA provides several deployment options, including single-node
deployments on-premise or in a cloud environment using hardware such as Xeon
Scalable Processors, Gaudi servers, NVIDIA GPUs, and even on AI PCs.  It also
supports Kubernetes deployments with and without the GenAI Management Console
(GMC), as well as cloud-native deployments using RHOCP.

How It Works
************

The ChatQnA Examples follows a basic flow of information in the chatbot system,
starting from the user input and going through the retrieve, re-ranker, and
generate components, ultimately resulting in the bot's output.

   This diagram illustrates the flow of information in the chatbot system,
   starting from the user input and going through the retrieve, analyze, and
   generate components, ultimately resulting in the bot's output.

The architecture follows a series of steps to process user queries and generate responses:

1. **Embedding**: The user query is first transformed into a numerical
   representation called an embedding. This embedding captures the semantic
   meaning of the query and allows for efficient comparison with other
   embeddings.
#. **Vector Database**: The embedding is then used to search a vector database,
   which stores relevant data points as vectors. The vector database enables
   efficient and semantic retrieval of information based on the similarity
   between the query embedding and the stored vectors.
#. **Re-ranker**: Uses a model to rank the retrieved data on their saliency.
   The vector database retrieves the most relevant data
   points based on the query embedding. These data points can include documents,
   articles, or any other relevant information that can help generate accurate
   responses.
#. **LLM**: The retrieved data points are then passed to large language models
   (LLM) for further processing. LLMs are powerful generative models that have
   been trained on a large corpus of text data. They can generate human-like
   responses based on the input data.
#. **Generate Response**: The LLMs generate a response based on the input data
   and the user query. This response is then returned to the user as the
   chatbot's answer.

Microservice Outline and Diagram
================================

A GenAI application or pipeline in OPEA  typically consists of a collection of microservices to create a megaservice, accessed via a gateway. A microservice is a component designed to perform a specific function or task. Microservices are building blocks, offering the fundamental services. Microservices promote modularity, flexibility, and scalability in the system. A megaservice is a higher-level architectural construct composed of one or more microservices, providing the capability to assemble end-to-end applications.
The gateway serves as the interface for users to access. The gateway routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices within the megaservice architecture. See `GenAI Components <https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps>`_ for more information.

Troubleshooting

TDB.

Monitoring
**********

Now that you have deployed the ChatQnA example, let's talk about monitoring the performance of the microservices in the ChatQnA pipeline.

Monitoring the performance of microservices is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of the generative AI systems. By monitoring metrics such as latency and throughput, you can identify bottlenecks, detect anomalies, and optimize the performance of individual microservices. This allows us to proactively address any issues and ensure that the ChatQnA pipeline is running efficiently.

This document will help you understand how to monitor in real time the latency, throughput, and other metrics of different microservices. You will use **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, both open-source toolkits, to collect metrics and visualize them in a dashboard.

Set Up the Prometheus Server
============================

Prometheus is a tool used for recording real-time metrics and is specifically designed for monitoring microservices and alerting based on their metrics.

The `/metrics` endpoint on the port running each microservice exposes the metrics in the Prometheus format. The Prometheus server scrapes these metrics and stores them in its time series database. For example, metrics for the Text Generation Interface (TGI) service are available at:

.. code-block:: bash

   http://${host_ip}:9009/metrics

Set up the Prometheus server:

1. Download Prometheus:
   Download the Prometheus v2.52.0 from the official site, and extract the files:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.52.0/prometheus-2.52.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf prometheus-2.52.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

2. Configure Prometheus:
   Change the directory to the Prometheus folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd prometheus-2.52.0.linux-amd64

Edit the `prometheus.yml` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   vim prometheus.yml

Change the ``job_name`` to the name of the microservice you want to monitor. Also change the ``targets`` to the job target endpoint of that microservice. Make sure the service is running and the port is open, and that it exposes the metrics that follow Prometheus convention at the ``/metrics`` endpoint.

Here is an example of exporting metrics data from a TGI microservice to Prometheus:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
   # Here it's Prometheus itself.
   scrape_configs:
     # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
     - job_name: "tgi"

       # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
       # scheme defaults to 'http'.

       static_configs:
         - targets: ["localhost:9009"]

Here is another example of exporting metrics data from a TGI microservice (inside a Kubernetes cluster) to Prometheus:

.. code-block:: yaml

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: "tgi"
   
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["llm-dependency-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:9009"]

3. Run the Prometheus server:
Run the Prometheus server, without hanging-up the process:
```bash
nohup ./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yml &
```

4. Access the Prometheus UI
   Access the Prometheus UI at the following URL:

.. code-block:: bash

   http://localhost:9090/targets?search=

>Note: Before starting Prometheus, ensure that no other processes are running on the designated port (default is 9090). Otherwise, Prometheus will not be able to scrape the metrics.

On the Prometheus UI, you can see the status of the targets and the metrics that are being scraped. You can search for a metrics variable by typing it in the search bar.

The TGI metrics can be accessed at:

.. code-block:: bash

   http://${host_ip}:9009/metrics 

Set Up the Grafana Dashboard
============================

Grafana is a tool used for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards. It can be used to create custom dashboards that display the metrics collected by Prometheus.

To set up the Grafana dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Download Grafana:
   Download the Grafana v8.0.6 from the official site, and extract the files:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-11.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar -zxvf grafana-11.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

For adddiitonal instructions, see the complete `Grafana installation instructions  <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/>`_.

2. Run the Grafana server:
   Change the directory to the Grafana folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd grafana-11.0.0

Run the Grafana server, without hanging-up the process:

.. code-block:: bash

   nohup ./bin/grafana-server &

3. Access the Grafana dashboard UI:
   On your browser, access the Grafana dashboard UI at the following URL:

.. code-block:: bash

   http://localhost:3000

>Note: Before starting Grafana, ensure that no other processes are running on port 3000.

Log in to Grafana using the default credentials:

.. code-block:: 

   username: admin
   password: admin

4. Add Prometheus as a data source:
   You need to configure the data source for Grafana to scrape data from. Click on the "Data Source" button, select Prometheus, and specify the Prometheus URL ``http://localhost:9090``.

   Then, you need to upload a JSON file for the dashboard's configuration. You can upload it in the Grafana UI under ``Home > Dashboards > Import dashboard``. A sample JSON file is supported here: `tgi_grafana.json  <https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/blob/main/assets/tgi_grafana.json>`_

5. View the dashboard:
   Finally, open the dashboard in the Grafana UI, and you will see different panels displaying the metrics data.

   Taking the TGI microservice as an example, you can see the following metrics:
   * Time to first token
   * Decode per-token latency
   * Throughput (generated tokens/sec)
   * Number of tokens per prompt
   * Number of generated tokens per request

   You can also monitor the incoming requests to the microservice, the response time per token, etc., in real time.
