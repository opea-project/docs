GenAI Microservices
###################

GenAI microservices leverage a service composer to
assemble a mega-service tailored for real-world Enterprise AI applications. All
the microservices are containerized, allowing cloud native deployment. Checkout
how the microservices are used in :ref:`GenAIExamples`.

We're building this microservices documentation from content in the
:GenAIComps_blob:`GenAIComps<README.md>` GitHub repository.
